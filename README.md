## 🚀 Overview
**Snake Game** is a classic arcade-style game implemented in **Python** using **Pygame**.  
The goal is simple: control the snake, eat food, grow longer, and avoid colliding with yourself.  

This project demonstrates **real-time game mechanics, event handling, and basic game physics**.

---

## ✨ Key Features
✅ **Snake Movement** – Smooth, responsive controls using arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).  
✅ **Eating Food** – Food items appear randomly; snake grows and score increases when eaten.  
✅ **Game Over Conditions** – Ends when the snake collides with itself.  
✅ **Sound Effects** – Eating, background, and game over sounds.  
✅ **Visual Feedback** – Flash effect when eating food.

- Snake moves continuously in the last directed arrow key direction.

- Food appears randomly; consuming it increases the score and snake length.

- The snake wraps around screen edges.

- Game ends when the snake collides with itself.
